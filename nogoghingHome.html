            <h2>Finding Who is right for you</h2>
            <p>
                As far as I am aware, not many people know how to
                tell right off the bat if a potential bandmate will
                be a good fit for the band. I have seen many bands
                go through multiple members in a short amount of time.
                This website is designed to help bands figure out whether
                or not a potential bandmate is right for them before trying
                to commit to them long-term.
            </p>
            <h2>How The Other Pages Work</h2>
            <p>
                Each of the other pages is dedicated to a specific
                instrument typically used in a band these days. Each 
                page has questions that a band should ask a potential bandmate 
                in order to figure out if they are right for the band. The
                questions are designed to get a feel for the person's
                experience, dedication, and personality. In addition, there
                will be a provided list of recommended activities to determine
                if bonding with the person is possible. This is important
                because it is easier to play with someone you think of as a
                friend and someday family.
            </p>

            <h2>My Experience/Info Sources</h2>
            <p>
                I have been in a few bands over the years as an inexpereinced 
                drummer, and I have always been the odd man out. To the right, you will see
                a low-res example of me not fitting with a band. Despite my lack of skill,
                I have managed to take notes on the common mistakes these bands have made in 
                picking me. The drummer page is heavily influenced by my own experiences because of this.
                The other pages mainly use the following reddit pages, but google ai was 
                surprisingly useful for the dj page.:
