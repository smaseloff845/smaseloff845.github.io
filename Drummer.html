            <h3>Questions to ask your future drummer</h3>
            <p>
                Below are a list of questions that you should ask your potential 
                drummer. These questions are designed to get a feel for their 
                experience, dedication, and personality. I cannot tell you what 
                the right answers are or how you should interpret their answers, 
                but I can tell you that these are the questions that have helped 
                other bands determine that I was not the right fit for them.
                <ul>
                    <li>How long have you been playing the drums?</li>
                    <li>Have you ever performed live? or What is your band history?</li>
                    <li>What are your long-term goals as a drummer?</li>
                    <li>What is your personal life like? (This is to determine if they
                        have a hectic life that could bleed into the band)</li>
                    <li>What styles of music are you most comfortable playing?</li>
                    <li>What are your favorite bands?</li>
                    <li>Are you open to collaborating on songwriting and arrangements?</li>
                    <li>Do you usually write down your drum parts or go by memory?</li>
                    <li>How many times a week do you typically practice?</li>
                    <li>What is your usual availability during the week?</li>
                    <li>
                        Do you have your own drum kit? If yes, ask "Would you be
                        more comfortable if we practiced at your place or a practice studio?"
                        (If yes to that one, ask if they have room for the rest of the band) 
                        If no, ask "Where do you usually practice?"
                    </li>
                    <li>How well do you handle constructive criticism?</li>
                    <li>What would your ideal band be?</li>
                    <li>
                        If politics could disrupt the band, ask "What kind of
                        benefit shows they feel comfortable playing?" to subtly
                        find out their political views.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Activities</h3>
            <p>
                Below are a list of activities to do that could
                help. However, the only ones that I would consider
                as required are the ones marked as musical. The other 
                activities are fun and good for bonding, but not guaranteed
                to help. Adjust any of these activities as you see fit because
                these are just the outlines of what I would do.
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Activity Name</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                    <th>musical or bonding?</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Solo Play</td>
                    <td class="text">
                        This activity is the most important and probably the most 
                        obvious. Have them play something for you. It could be an 
                        entire song, a solo, or just a groove. Also, let them know
                        to let loose and imagine they are on stage so you can get an
                        idea for their stage presence.
                    </td>
                    <td>musical</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Attend a Concert Together</td>
                    <td class="text">
                        This activity is a great way to bond over similar tastes
                        in music. It also gives you a chance to see how they
                        behave in a social setting. Do they seem respectful to
                        others? If you go to a rock or metal concert, do they
                        mosh? If they do, do they follow the mosh etiquette of
                        picking someone up when they fall? This is a good way to
                        tell if they are a good person.
                    </td>
                    <td>bonding</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Group Practice</td>
                    <td class="text">
                        This is another crucial activity. You need to play with them
                        to see how well they fit in with the rest of the band. Do they 
                        listen to the other musicians, interpret the feel of the song,
                        and adjust their playing accordingly? Do they play too loud or 
                        too soft? For Drummers, this is especially important because they 
                        are the backbone. Do they keep time well? Is their timing consistent?
                    </td>
                    <td>musical</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Social Hangout (e.g., coffee, dinner, karaoke)</td>
                    <td class="text">
                        This activity is good for getting to know the person outside 
                        of a musical setting. It helps to see if you have similar 
                        interests and if you can get along on a personal level. Remember, 
                        you will be spending a lot of time with this person if they join 
                        the band, so it's important to make sure you like them as a person.
                        The activities listed are just suggestions. Pick something that you 
                        will all enjoy. Although, karaoke is a great way to find out if they
                        can loosen up, and if they have stage fright that they aren't telling
                        you about.
                    </td>
                    <td>bonding</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Improvization</td>
                    <td class="text">
                        Have them improvise a solo or groove. This will
                        show you how well they can think on their feet and
                        how creative they are. Trust me, you don't want to be
                        stuck with a Ringo. You want someone who can actually 
                        help with the songwriting process.
                    </td>
                    <td>musical</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Team-building Activities (e.g., escape room, pictionary/charades)</td>
                    <td class="text">
                        These activities are great for bonding and learning how 
                        to work together as a team. If they can work with others
                        and if they will work with your bandmates are two different
                        things. Everyone communicates differently, and these activities 
                        can help the new person learn how to communicate with the others.
                        Plus, these activities are fun and can help break the ice.
