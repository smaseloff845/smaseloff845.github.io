            <h3>Questions to ask your future guitarist</h3>
            <p>
                Below are a list of questions that you should ask your potential 
                guitarist. These questions are designed to get a feel for their experience, dedication, 
                and personality. I cannot tell you what the right answers are or how you 
                should interpret their answers. I can't even tell you that these questions 
                are guaranteed to help. Because I am not a guitarist, some of this information, 
                and probably the most helpful questions, are coming from the guitarist and 
                vocalist reddit pages linked on the home page and right before the questions. 
                For obvious reasons, some of the questions I got from the vocalist page have 
                been changed to fit a guitarist. If you want more detail on why those questions, 
                you can check there. Although, most of the questions are ones that I would ask if 
                I were looking for a guitarist. Also, if I left anything out, please fill out the
                feedback form linked at the bottom of the page.<br>

            <ul>
                <li>How long have you been playing the guitar?</li>
                <li>Can you comp chords(follow chords on a sheet in real time)?</li>
                <li>Have you ever performed live? or What is your band history?</li>
                <li>What are your long-term goals as a guitarist?</li>
                <li>What is your personal life like? (This is to determine if they
                    have a hectic life that could bleed into the band)</li>
                <li>What styles of music are you most comfortable playing?</li>
                <li>What are your favorite bands?</li>
                <li>Are you open to collaborating on songwriting and arrangements?</li>
                <li>How many times a week do you typically practice?</li>
                <li>What is your usual availability during the week?</li>
                <li>How well do you handle constructive criticism?</li>
                <li>What would your ideal band be?</li>
                <li>
                    If politics could disrupt the band, ask "What kind of
                    benefit shows they feel comfortable playing?" to subtly
                    find out their political views.

            <h3>Activities</h3>
            <p>
                Below are a list of activities to do that could
                help. However, the only ones that I would consider
                as required are the ones marked as musical. The other 
                activities are fun and good for bonding, but not guaranteed
                to help. Adjust any of these activities as you see fit because
                these are just the outlines of what I would do.
            </p>

                <tr>
                    <th>Activity Name</th>

                <tr>
                    <td>Solo Play</td>
                    <td class="text">
                        This activity is the most important and probably the most 
                        obvious. Have them play something for you. It could be an 
                        entire song, a solo, or just a riff. Also, let them know
                        to let loose and imagine they are on stage so you can get an
                        idea for their stage presence.
                    </td>
                    <td>musical</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Attend a Concert Together</td>
                    <td class="text">
                        This activity is a great way to bond over similar tastes
                        in music. It also gives you a chance to see how they
                        behave in a social setting. Do they seem respectful to
                        others? If you go to a rock or metal concert, do they
                        mosh? If they do, do they follow the mosh etiquette of
                        picking someone up when they fall? This is a good way to
                        tell if they are a good person.
                    </td>
                    <td>bonding</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Group Practice</td>
                    <td class="text">
                        This is another crucial activity. You need to play with them
                        to see how well they fit in with the rest of the band. Do they 
                        listen to the other musicians, interpret the feel of the song,
                        and adjust their playing accordingly? Do they play too loud or 
                        too soft? Are they playing in time with the drummer?
                    </td>
                    <td>musical</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Social Hangout (e.g., coffee, dinner, karaoke)</td>
                    <td class="text">
                        This activity is good for getting to know the person outside 
                        of a musical setting. It helps to see if you have similar 
                        interests and if you can get along on a personal level. Remember, 
                        you will be spending a lot of time with this person if they join 
                        the band, so it's important to make sure you like them as a person.
                        The activities listed are just suggestions. Pick something that you 
                        will all enjoy. Although, karaoke is a great way to find out if they
                        can loosen up, and if they have stage fright that they aren't telling
                        you about.
                    </td>
                    <td>bonding</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Songwriting</td>
                    <td class="text">
                        This activity is just for if you write or plan on writing 
                        your own songs. Give them a song you have written and ask 
                        them to come up with a guitar riff and/or lyrics for it. This will
                        give you a good feel of what their input into the band will be like.
                        Do they come up with something that fits the feel of the band?
                    </td>
                    <td>musical</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Team-building Activities (e.g., escape room, pictionary/charades)</td>
                    <td class="text">
                        These activities are great for bonding and learning how 
                        to work together as a team. If they can work with others
                        and if they will work with your bandmates are two different
                        things. Everyone communicates differently, and these activities 
                        can help the new person learn how to communicate with the others.
                        Plus, these activities are fun and can help break the ice.
